# 18. Data Retention Policy

Despite not being a requirement within HIPAA, Cloudticity understands and appreciates the importance of health data retention. Acting as a subcontractor, and at times a business associate, Cloudticity is not directly responsible for health and medical records retention as set forth by each state. Despite this, Cloudticity has created and implemented the following policy to make it easier for Cloudticity customers to support data retention laws.

## 18.1 State Medical Record Laws

* [Listing of state requirements for medical record retention.](http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/appa7-1.pdf)

## 18.2 Data Retention Policy

* Current Cloudticity customers do not have data stored by Cloudticity as a part of the Cloudticity services.
* If a Cloudticity customer does have data stored by Cloudticity and the customer ceases to be a customer, the following steps will be taken:
  1. The customer is sent a notice via email of change of standing, and given the option to reinstate account.
  2. If no response to notice in #1 above is received within 7 days, or if the customer responds they do not want to reinstate the account, customer is sent directions for how to download their data from Cloudticity and/or to have Cloudticity continue to store the data at a rate of $25/month for up to 100GB. If there is more than 100GB of data, Cloudticity will work with customer to determine storage costs.
  3. If the customer downloads the data or does not respond to notices from Cloudticity within 30 days, Cloudticity removes the data from the Cloudticity systems and the customer is sent notice of the data removal.
