# 10. Facility Access Policy

Cloudticity was born in the cloud, and has never been saddled with physical infrastructure. From the beginning we decided to focus on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Of note, Cloudticity does not have ready access to ePHI; it provides cloud-based, compliant infrastructure to covered entities and business associates. Cloudticity does not physically house any systems used by its platform in Cloudticity facilities. Physical security of our platform servers is outlined in [ยง1.4](01-introduction.md#14-cloudticity-organizational-concepts).
