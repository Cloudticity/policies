## 21.2 Policies to Assure 3rd Parties Support Cloudticity Compliance

1. Cloudticity does not allow 3rd party access to production systems containing ePHI.
2. All connections and data in transit between the Cloudticity Oxygen managed services platform and 3rd parties are encrypted end to end.
3. A standard business associate agreement with customers and partners is defined and includes the required security controls in accordance with the organization's security policies. Additionally, responsibility is assigned in these agreements.
4. Cloudticity has Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with subcontractors with an agreed service arrangement addressing liability, service definitions, security controls, and aspects of services management.
   * Subcontractors must coordinate, manage, and communicate any changes to services provided to Cloudticity.
   * Cloudticity utilizes monitoring tools to regularly evaluate subcontractors against relevant SLAs.
5. No Cloudticity customers or partners have access outside of their own environment, meaning they cannot access, modify, or delete anything related to other 3rd parties.
6. Cloudticity does not outsource software development.
7. Cloudticity maintains and annually reviews a list of all current partners and subcontractors. This list is maintained by the Cloudticity Privacy Officer, includes details on all provided services, and is recorded according to [ยง1.4](01-introduction.md#14-cloudticity-organizational-concepts). The annual review is conducted as a part of the below referenced SLA review.
8. Cloudticity assesses security requirements and compliance considerations with all partners and subcontractors. This includes annual assessment of SOC2 Reports for all Cloudticity infrastructure partners.
   * Cloudticity leverages recurring Teamwork tasks to assure reviews of SLAs with all 3rd parties are performed annually. These are performed by the Cloudticity Security Officer and Privacy Officer. The process for reviewing SLAs is outlined below:
     1. The SLA review is initiated by a recurring task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
     2. The Security Officer, or a Privacy Officer, is assigned the task to review the SLA and performance of 3rd parties. The list of current 3rd parties is also reviewed to assure it is up to date and complete.
     3. SLA performance is documented in the task.
     4. Once the review is completed and documented, the Security Officer approves or rejects the task. If the task is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
     5. If the task is approved, the Security Officer then marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
9. Regular review is conducted as required by SLAs to assure security and compliance. These reviews include reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, and failures and disruptions. Any identified issues are investigated and resolved in a reasonable and timely manner.
10. Any changes to partner and subcontractor services and systems are reviewed before implementation, when possible.
11. For all partners, Cloudticity reviews activity annually to assure partners are in line with SLAs in contracts with Cloudticity.
12. SLA review is monitored on a quarterly basis using Teamwork reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
