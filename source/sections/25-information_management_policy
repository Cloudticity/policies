# 25. Information Management Policy

Cloudticity implements information management policies and procedures to maintain organization and availability of information. All Cloudticity workforce members are required to follow the guidelines presented.

Cloudticity information falls into two categories: Internal and External
* Internal information, defined as intellectual property or sensitive information, including development guidelines, proprietary code, etc must be organized according to Cloudticity's development standards as defined in the "Cloudticity - Technology" Teamwork project overview.
* External Information, defined as all non-internal information, including marketing collateral, opportunity information, data sheets, white papers, etc must go into Google Drive > Cloudticity Shared > Marketing. There is a folder structure in place that must be used. All new content and information should be properly organized. If there is any confusion as to where something should live, then personnel are encouraged to ask leadership.

Important Notes:
* Duplicates are okay but should be kept to a minimum. Prior to uploading a new piece of information, personnel are encourged to quickly browse the section where the information is being uploaded (Example: I have a new piece of MagicBox collateral to upload and see there is a MagicBox folder under collateral. Before uploading, I would quickly browse the folder to verify that I am not confusing our team by having two of the same content).
* If a replacement is being uploaded (a new MagicBox logo for example), then the old piece must be moved into the "_Archive" folder (found in the root Marketing folder) prior to uploading the new version (the archive is not organized, does not need to be, and has no folder structure).
