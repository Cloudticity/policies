# 26. Knowledge Management Policy

Cloudticity implements knowledge management policies and procedures to maintain organization and availability of written lessons learned across the organization for the purpose of increasing efficiencies and reducing risks from knowledge gained through experience. All Cloudticity workforce members are required to follow the guidelines presented.

## 26.1 References: Some external resources were used to craft this policy. These are:

## 26.2 Definitions and Relationships:
* Data - Facts and figures which relay something specific, but which are not organized in any way and which provide no further information regarding patterns, context, etc. I will use the definition for data presented by Thierauf (1999): "unstructured facts and figures that have the least impact on the typical manager."
* Information - For data to become information, it must be contextualized, categorized, calculated and condensed (Davenport & Prusak 2000). Information thus paints a bigger picture; it is data with relevance and purpose (Bali et al 2009). It may convey a trend in the environment, or perhaps indicate a pattern of sales for a given period of time. Essentially information is found "in answers to questions that begin with such words as who, what, where, when, and how many" (Ackoff 1999).
* Knowledge - Closely linked to doing and implies know-how and understanding. The knowledge possessed by each individual is a product of his experience, and encompasses the norms by which he evaluates new inputs from his surroundings (Davenport & Prusak 2000). I will use the definition presented by Gamble and Blackwell (2001), based closely on a previous definition by Davenport & Prusak:
"Knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, values, contextual information, expert insight, and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the mind of the knowers. In organizations it often becomes embedded not only in documents or repositories, but also in organizational routines, practices and norms."

## 26.3 Role of Individual Staff
* All individual staff shall be responsible for gathering, organizing, and sharing their own explicit and tacit knowledge;
* All individual staff shall define their key knowledge goals that align to the departmental objectives and goals;
* All individual staff shall continuously update their own profile in all applications;
* All individual staff shall be encouraged to attend knowledge sharing sessions organized by the company;
* All individual staff shall update databases (Google Drive - internal and Knowledge Base - internal/external) of good work practices and lessons learned to retain organizational knowledge.

## 26.3 Categorization (Change to "Location Guide"? with each location and a description of what can be found in the location)
There are many ways to categorize knowledge. Cloudticity organizes data, information, and knowledge:
* By Audience:
* * Internal (Cloudticity Only) - Intellectual property or sensitive information, including development guidelines and proprietary code, must be stored in appropriate locations and organized according to Cloudticity's standards.
* * Internal-Restricted (Cloudticity Limited) - Sensitive information with limited visibility. Examples: Employment records and financial statements.
* * External-Private (Customers Only) - Customer specific assets such as opportunity information, personnel information, process/procedural knowledge.
* * External (Public) - Marketing collateral, data sheets, white papers, website, or anything else that can be consumed by public audiences.

* By Application:
* * Google Drive
* * Zendesk Knowledge Base
* * S3
* * Github
* * HubSpot
* * Teamwork Notebooks
* * Cloudticity Website
* * AWS Website
* * LucidChart

## 26.4 Important Notes & Best Practices
* Cloudticity's two main repositories of knowledge (Google Drive > Cloudticity Shared folder & Knowledge Base) have standards of organization that must be maintained. If there is any confusion as to where something should live, then personnel are encouraged to ask leadership.
* Duplicates are acceptable but should be kept to a minimum. Prior to uploading a new piece of information, personnel are encourged to quickly browse the section where the information is being uploaded (Example: I have a new piece of MagicBox collateral to upload and see there is a MagicBox folder under collateral. Before uploading, I would quickly browse the folder and Google Drive to verify that I am not confusing our team by having two of the same content).
* If a replacement is being uploaded (a new MagicBox logo for example), then the old piece must be moved into the "_Archive" folder (found in the root Marketing folder) prior to uploading the new version (the archive is not organized, does not need to be, and has no folder structure).
