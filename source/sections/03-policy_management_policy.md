# 3. Policy Management Policy

Cloudticity implements policies and procedures to maintain compliance and integrity of data. The Security Officer and Privacy Officer are responsible for maintaining policies and procedures and assuring all Cloudticity workforce members, business associates, customers, and partners are adherent to all applicable policies. Previous versions of policies are retained to assure ease of finding policies at specific historic dates in time.

## 3.1 Applicable Standards

### 3.1.1 Applicable Standards from the HITRUST Common Security Framework

* 12.c - Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans Including Information Security

### 3.1.2 Applicable Standards from the HIPAA Security Rule

* 164.316(a) - Policies and Procedures
* 164.316(b)(1)(i) - Documentation

## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies

1. All policies are stored and up to date to maintain Cloudticity compliance with HIPAA, HITRUST, NIST, and other relevant standards. Updates and version control are done similar to source code control.
2. Policy update requests can be made by any workforce member at any time. Furthermore, all policies are reviewed annually by both the Security and Privacy Officer to assure they are accurate and up-to-date.
3. Cloudticity employees may request changes to policies using the following process:
  1. The Cloudticity employee initiates a policy change request by creating a task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA). Optionally, the Cloudticity employee may also submit a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.
  3. Once the review is complete, the Security Officer approves or rejects the request. If the request is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the request is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then merges the pull request and marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
  5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using Cloudticity's [change management process (ยง9.4)](#9.4-changing-existing-systems).
4. All policies are made accessible to all Cloudticity workforce members. The current master policies are published at [https://github.com/Cloudticity/policies](https://github.com/Cloudticity/policies).
   * Changes are automatically communicated to all Cloudticity team members through integrations between GitHub and Slack that log all GitHub policy channels to a dedicated Cloudticity Slack Channel.
   * The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.
5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later
   1. Version history of all Cloudticity policies is done via GitHub.
   2. Backup storage of all policies is done with Google Drive.
6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to Cloudticity's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Cloudticity management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating a task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current Cloudticity policies ([https://github.com/Cloudticity/policies](https://github.com/Cloudticity/policies)).
  3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the task.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the change. If the change is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  5. If the change is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then merges the pull request and marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
  6. Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using Teamwork reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
7. Cloudticity utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. Cloudticity also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results at [https://hipaa.cloudticity.com](https://hipaa.cloudticity.com). In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, Cloudticity uses the following process to track HITRUST audits, both full and interim:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the HITRUST audit activity by creating a task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the HITRUST activity.
  3. Once the HITRUST activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the activity.
  5. If the activity is approved, the Security Officer or Privacy Officer then merges the pull request and marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
  6. Compliance with annual compliance assessments, utilizing the HITRUST CSF as a framework, is monitored on a quarterly basis using Teamwork reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

Additional documentation related to maintenance of policies is outlined in [ยง5.3.1](#5.3-security-officer).
