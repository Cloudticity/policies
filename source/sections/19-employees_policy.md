See [§7.8](07-systems_access_policy.md#78-employee-workstation-use).

Additionally, remote security is maintained through the use of VPN tunnels for all access to production systems with access to ePHI data.
8. Employees may only use Cloudticity-purchased and -owned workstations for accessing production systems with access to ePHI data. Mobile devices may be used to access Cloudticity's ticket management system, communication platform, project management software, or company email.
   * Any workstations used to access production systems must be configured as prescribed in [§7.8](07-systems_access_policy.md#78-employee-workstation-use).
   * Any workstations used to access production systems must have virus protection software installed, configured, and enabled according to [§7.8](07-systems_access_policy.md#78-employee-workstation-use).

Candidates are informed about the background checks and sign a release form.  These checks are conducted by either the CEO or the COO through an independent agency in accordance with any appropriate legislation.  In addition, workforce members are screened for eligibility to work in the U.S. during their first week of employment.  All workforce members also sign an employment agreement, which includes confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.  These are reviewed at least annually and when changes occur that influence these 
requirements, such as applicable laws and regulations for the jurisdiction to which they apply.
15.  Upon termination or changes in employment for employees, contractors, third-party users or other workforce arrangement, physical and logical access rights and associated materials (e.g., passwords, keycards, keys, documentation that identify them as current members of the organization) are removed or modified to restrict access within 24 hours and old accounts are closed after 90 days of opening new accounts.  Cloudticity also ensures employees or workforce members that are terminated understand their obligations to ensure any covered information for which they had prior access remains confidential (e.g., during an exit interview).  When an employee or other workforce members move to a new position of trust, logical and physical access controls are re-evaluated as soon as possible but not to exceed thirty (30) days.

## 19.3 Issue Escalation

Cloudticity workforce members are to escalate issues to the Chief Executive Officer.

Security incidents, particularly those involving ePHI, are handled using the process described in [§11.2](11-incident_response_policy.md#112-incident-management-policies). If the incident involves a breach of ePHI, the Security Officer will manage the incident using the process described in [§12.2](12-breach_policy.md#122-cloudticity-breach-policy). Refer to [§11.2](11-incident_response_policy.md#112-incident-management-policies) for a list of sample items that can trigger Cloudticity's incident response procedures; if you are unsure whether the issue is a security incident, contact the Security Officer immediately.

It is the duty of the CEO to follow the process outlined below:

1. Create a private task in the Teamwork project "Cloudticity - Compliance".
2. The task is investigated, documented, and, when a conclusion or remediation is reached, it is assigned to another workforce member for review.
3. The task is reviewed by the other workforce member. If the task is rejected, it goes back for further evaluation and review.
4. If the task is approved, it is marked as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
5. The workforce member that initiated the process is notified of the outcome.
