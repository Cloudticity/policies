# 16. Vulnerability Scanning Policy

Cloudticity is proactive about information security and understands that vulnerabilities need to be monitored on an ongoing basis. Cloudticity utilizes [Nessus Scanner](http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) from Tenable to consistently scan, identify, and address vulnerabilities on our systems. We also utilize [TMDS](https://www.trendmicro.com) on all systems, including logs, for file integrity checking and intrusion detection.

## 16.2 Vulnerability Scanning Policy

1. Nessus management is performed by the Cloudticity Security Officer with assistance from the VP of Engineering.
2. Nessus is used to monitor all internal IP addresses (servers, VMs, etc) on Cloudticity networks.
3. Frequency of scanning is as follows:
  1. on a weekly basis;
  2. after every production deployment.
4. Reviewing Nessus reports and findings, as well as any further investigation into discovered vulnerabilities, are the responsibility of the Cloudticity Security Officer. The process for reviewing Nessus reports is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the review of a Nessus Report by creating a task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
  2. The Security Officer, or a Cloudticity Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to review the Nessus Report.
  3. If new vulnerabilities are found during review, the process below is used to test those vulnerabilities is outlined below. Once those steps are completed, the task is then reviewed again.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the task. If the task is rejected, it goes back for further review.
  5. If the task is approved, the Security Officer then marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
5. In the case of new vulnerabilities, the following steps are taken:
  * All new vulnerabilities are verified manually to assure they are repeatable. Those not found to be repeatable are manually tested after the next vulnerability scan, regardless of if the specific vulnerability is discovered again.
  * Vulnerabilities that are repeatable manually are documented and reviewed by the Security Officer, VP of Engineering, and Privacy Officer to see if they are part of the current risk assessment performed by Cloudticity.
    * Those that are a part of the current risk assessment are checked for mitigations.
    * Those that are not part of the current risk assessment trigger a new risk assessment, and this process is outlined in detail in the Cloudticity Risk Assessment Policy.
6. All vulnerability scanning reports are retained for 6 years by Cloudticity. Vulnerability report review is monitored on a quarterly basis using Teamwork reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
7. Penetration testing is performed regularly as part of the Cloudticity vulnerability management policy.
  * External penetration testing is performed bi-annually by a third party.
  * Internal penetration testing is performed quarterly. Below is the process used to conduct internal penetration tests.
      1. The Security Officer initiates the penetration test by creating a task in the Teamwork project: Compliance Review Activity (CRA).
      2. The Security Officer, or a Cloudticity Security Engineer assigned by the Security Officer, is assigned to conduct the penetration test.
      3. Gaps and vulnerabilities identified during penetration testing are reviewed, with plans for correction and/or mitigation, by the Cloudticity Security Officer before the task can move to be approved.
      4. Once the testing is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the task. If the task is rejected, it goes back for further testing and review.
      5. If the task is approved, the Security Officer then marks the task as Complete, adding any pertinent notes required.
  * Penetration tests results are retained for 6 years by Cloudticity.
  * Internal penetration testing is monitored on an annual basis using Teamwork reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
8. This vulnerability policy is reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Security Officer and Privacy Officer.
